Flight Delay Analysis â€“ Python Project
Data Processing & Cleaning: Used Pandas to handle missing values, filter relevant flight data, and transform date-time formats for accurate delay analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged Seaborn to visualize trends in flight delays based on factors such as airline, airport, time of day, and weather conditions.

Statistical Insights: Analyzed correlations between flight delays and external factors like seasonality, air traffic congestion, and flight distance.

Interactive Dashboards (Optional, if applicable): Created visual reports using Matplotlib/Seaborn to present findings effectively.

Predictive Modeling (Optional, if applicable): Explored machine learning models to predict flight delays based on historical data.

Performance Optimization: Used vectorized operations in Pandas for efficient data handling and reduced processing time.
